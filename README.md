# Lightning Network Graph Analysis

Analyse the lightning network graph to find articulation points

Uses `lncli describegraph` output, which is piped through
[lightning-network-graphxml](https://github.com/kulpreet/lightning-network-graphxml)
before being processed using BGL here.

More info coming soon.
